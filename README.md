## Description

"The truth is – the pathetically, stupidly, inconveniently obvious truth is – helping only ourselves is bad and helping each other is good." - *Steve Basilone & Annie Mebane*

----

Adds tin ore, tin plates, solder, organotins, and (optionaly) tinned cable to the game.

This mod largely retains the vanilla feel and is not very complex on its own. If used alongside many of the other BZ mods, the game will become quite a bit more complex.

If you want a vanilla-esque game with some tweaks, try this mod, or perhaps a less complex one like [Titanium](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bztitanium) or [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead).

### Details
Tin is an early game resource and is slightly easier to process than other metals. It is mostly used in solder and organotins.

Supported compatible mods:

- Space Exploration (>= 0.6.0) & AAI
- Krastorio 2
- 248k (beta)
- Several other mods like Deadlock Stacking, Deadlock Crating, etc.

Coming soon: RSO
Coming soon: FE+, 5Dim's, ModMash, etc.
Planned but not yet supported: Omnimatter, Simple Compress, and much more.

Many other mods are compatible, but not yet fully supported. Compatibility suggestions always appreciated.
